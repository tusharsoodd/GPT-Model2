# GPT-Model2

This is a project based off of the "All you need is attention" paper and Chat GPT and GPT 3 models by Open AI and their respective papers. The goal of this 
project is to develop a simple GPT model that follows in the footsteps of the aforementioned models. Currently the model is a character level model, and the training
data is the mini shakespeare corpus. However the corpus the model is trained on can be changed. 

Next step is to update the model to use a byte pair encoding, like Open AI's tiktoken encoding or Google's Sentence Piece encoding
